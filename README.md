# Welcome to whitelabel.

## What is whitelabel?

WL is a decentralised data structure for audio. Weâ€™ve created a V1 bare bones audio data structure and a factory smart contract to build, monetise and release your audio NFTs. Use our tools to build your own NFT market or jump over to the [Whitelabel Factory](https://whitelabel-factory.netlify.app) to release some music (and see it in action).

## What can I do with whitelabel?

Our current focus is on audio NFTs, however whitelabel can do much more. Here are a couple of use cases:

* You're a musician who wants to release your music as an NFT and create a marketplace for your fans to trade your music.&#x20;
* You're an agency and want to create custom branded minting and marketplace experiences for your clients.
* You're in a band or have collaborated on some work and want to release an NFT where any earnings can be automatically split between multiple parties.
* You're part of a community  who wants to release a NFT where a percentage of the earnings go back into a community fund to support future projects.
* You want to create a decentralise video platform similar to YouTube.
