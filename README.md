# Welcome to whitelabel.

## What is whitelabel?

Whitelabel is a collection of open source NFT smart contracts and subgraphs based on the ethereum blockchain that allows developers to create custom experiences for the minting and purchasing of NFTs.&#x20;

## What can I do with whitelabel?

We've built whitelabel to be as flexible as possible. Here are a couple of use cases :

* You're a musician who wants to release your music as an NFT and create a marketplace for your fans to trade your music.&#x20;
* You want to create custom branded minting and marketplace experiences for your clients.
* You want to release an NFT where any earnings can be automatically split between multiple parties.
* You want to release a community NFT where a percentage of the earnings go back into a community fund to support future projects.
