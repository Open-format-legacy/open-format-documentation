* Here you can see a number of details and statistics about your release.
* In the **splits** panel, you can see any splits you adding when creating your release. As previously mentioned, earnings are not automatically released. They need to be manually triggered from this view. To release any owed earnings to a specific address, press **Release Funds** next to the address of a split.
* Once you've release any earnings to a split address, you will see a list of payouts appear on the right hand side.&#x20;
